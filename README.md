# JDBC Explorer

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server for connecting LLM to databases via JDBC. This server is implemented using the [Spring AI MCP](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/mcp/mcp-overview.html) framework. The server exposes server tools, a prompt and resources to interact with the connected database.

## Tools üõ†

The server contains the following tools.

- **addBusinessInsight** 

    - Adds business insights discovered during data analysis to the "Business Insights" resource. Usually executed as part of the prompt "data-explorer"
    - Inputs:
        - `insight` (String): business insight discovered during data analysis 

- **executeQuery**

    - Executes a SQL query against the connected database, returning the results
    - Inputs:
        - `query` (string): the SQL query to be executed

- **getTableNames**

    - Gets the table names, including type, schema, and remarks
    - Inputs: none

- **describeTable**
    
    - Describe a table in the database including column information, primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes.
    - Inputs:
        - `catalog` (string, optional): Catalog Name
        - `schema` (string, optional): Schema Name
        - `tableName` (string): Name of the table to get description for

- **getDatabaseInfo**

    - Get information about the database including SQL dialect, keywords, database product name, etc.
    - Inputs: none

## Prompts üìÑ

The server contains 1 prompt.

- **data-explorer**

This prompt helps the user explore the data in their databases. It should present the user with a choice of dashboards that the LLM can create. The LLM will then execute the necessary queries and create the selected dashboard using an artifact.

The prompt result in Claude Desktop
